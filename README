Cpp Containers
==============

Cpp Containers is a C++ STL-like set of template container classes.
They complement STL standard containers with specialized ones.
They are design to be compatible with STL algorithms and iterator manipulations.
Header only, you can use them directly from installation on your system.
Stand-alone and BSD-like licence, you can include them directly in your project sources.

Available containers:
=====================
 - container::tape : memory consecutive dynamic array of elements with constant-time insertion before and after existing items (a vector with O(1) push_front).

And more to come ...
